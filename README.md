# Decision-Tree
In my project, I have implemented a Decision Tree algorithm to efficiently handle classification tasks, enabling precise decision-making based on various input features.
This implementation allows the system to recursively split the dataset into subsets based on the most significant attributes, optimizing the prediction accuracy for the target variable. The use of decision nodes and leaf nodes ensures a clear and interpretable model structure, facilitating the understanding of how decisions are made at each step. This approach not only enhances the performance of the classification process but also provides a robust framework for managing complex datasets with high reliability.
